## Project Overview
This project involved upgrading a small grocery store's online shopping list application by applying CSS styling to improve the user experience and visual appeal. The HTML structure was already in place, but customers were struggling with usability, particularly with the registration and login forms, while the product categories page lacked organization and visual coherence.

## Project Files Structure

### HTML Files
- **index.html**: Homepage of the shopping list application
- **login.html**: User login form
- **registration.html**: New user registration form
- **categories.html**: Product categories listing page
- **shopping-list.html**: User's shopping list/cart
- **feedback.html**: Customer feedback submission form
- **termsnconditions.html**: Website's terms and conditions
- **testfont.html**: Font testing page

### CSS Files
- **color-scheme.css**: Handles color palette and visual theme
- **form-styles.css**: Contains specific styles for forms (inputs, buttons)
- **styles.css**: General styles for layout, typography, and common styles

## Implemented Enhancements

### 1. Form Styling
**Goal**: Improve the usability and visual appeal of forms across the website.

**Implementation**:
- Linked the `form-styles.css` to the `login.html` page
- Applied a light gray background (`#f0f8ff`) to input fields for better visual definition
- Enhanced form elements with consistent padding, borders, and rounded corners
- Added hover effects to improve interactive feedback

**Files Modified**:
- `login.html`: Added CSS link tag
- `form-styles.css`: Enhanced input field styling

### 2. Table Enhancement
**Goal**: Improve readability and organization of product categories table.

**Implementation**:
- Added 10px padding to table cells (`<td>`) for better spacing
- Enhanced table headers (`<th>`) with:
  - White text color for better contrast against the blue background
  - Left-aligned text for consistent readability
  - Bold text to distinguish headers from regular data

**Files Modified**:
- `color-scheme.css`: Updated table styling rules

### 3. Button Styling with Internal CSS
**Goal**: Create more visually appealing and interactive buttons on the feedback form.

**Implementation**:
- Added internal CSS to `feedback.html`
- Created styles for submit and reset buttons:
  - Green color scheme for submit button with darker hover effect
  - Red color scheme for reset/clear button with darker red on hover
  - Applied padding, rounded corners, and font sizing for better usability
  - Added hover effects for better user interaction feedback

**Files Modified**:
- `feedback.html`: Added internal CSS style block

## Styling Approach

The project utilized three CSS implementation methods:
1. **External CSS**: Main styling through separate CSS files (`color-scheme.css`, `form-styles.css`)
2. **Internal CSS**: Page-specific styling using `<style>` tags in the document head
3. **CSS Selectors**: Used element, class, and ID selectors for targeted styling

## User Experience Improvements

- **Enhanced Form Readability**: Consistent spacing and styling make forms easier to complete
- **Improved Table Organization**: Better spacing and header styling make product categories easier to scan
- **Interactive Button Feedback**: Hover effects provide visual cues to users when interacting with buttons
- **Consistent Visual Theme**: Coordinated colors across the site for a cohesive brand experience

## Future Enhancements
